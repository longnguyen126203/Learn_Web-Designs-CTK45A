        <h1>Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h1>
        <p>This is a really simple dish to prepare and it’s always a big hit at parties. My father recommends:</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 40px;">"Make the night before so that the flavors have time to blend. Just bring it up to room temperature before you serve it. In the winter, try serving it warm.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>1 8oz. jar sundried tomatoes</p>
        <p>2 large garlic cloves</p>
        <p>2/3 c. kalamata olives</p>
        <p>1 t. capers</p>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>Combine tomatoes and garlic in a food processor. Blend until as smooth as possible. Add capers and olives. Pulse the motor a few times until they are incorporated, but still retain some texture.</p>

        <p>Serve on thin toast rounds with goat cheese and fresh basil garnish (optional).</p>
